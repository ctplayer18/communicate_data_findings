> Both the user types (subscriber and customer) mostly have duration of bike ride betwee 0-10 mins.

> Both the user types have same trends for month wise usage of bikes with March and April being the months were most of the rides are taken.

> We have find some interesting trends for user type subscribers. They use the service most during the working days and during the hours when the colleges and workplace satrts(8-9am) and when they finish (5-6 pm) which shows that subscribers have subscribed to the service so that can commute to their workplace or institutes.
